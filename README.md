# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sahring data, differenciated by city type. Also, using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Written report that summarizes how data differs by city type and how decisions are made from these reports. 

## Results
After cleaning the data set, and creating average fare for each City type, I created a DataFrame with Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Avaerage fare per ride, and per driver.

After which, I created a multi-line graph with total fare by city type, which includes the total fare over time.

## Summary

After creating the multi-line graph, it is clear that Urban city has the highest total rides, and highest driver count. However, 
Urban city has the lowest avergae fare per ride, and also aver fare per driver.

From the multi-line graph, we can see that total fare for Rural has been stable throughout the few months. Unlike Rural, Urban city and Suburban city has an increase of roughly $1000 after the end of April. 

This shows that there are a growth of population in those cities which caused a higher demand of PyBer rides.
